Carefully read your letter of authorization, sent to you by email, to learn about what you need to do next as a Concordia student. Key steps Recommended courses Course registration Academic regulations Resources for academic success Don’t forget these key steps: Check for possible fee exemptions Quebec residents pay a lower tuition rate at Concordia. If you are a Quebec resident, make sure you confirm your residency status with Concordia before the fee payment deadline to avoid extra charges.",
      "In some situations, non-residents qualify for the Quebec tuition rate. If you meet the criteria, apply online for Quebec residency status through your Student Centre (click “Quebec Residency Application”). Avoid a permanent code surcharge All students in Quebec have a permanent code. Provide Concordia with your permanent code by filling out the form online in your Student Centre to avoid extra fees. If you don’t already have a permanent code, Concordia will issue one when you fill out the form. Submit immigration documents, if you are an international student approved to register at Concordia.

You may have already completed equivalent courses in high school, Cegep, or other university.",
      "(Learn more) Recommended courses If you are taking courses as an Independent Student to meet the admissions requirements for a degree at Concordia, we encourage you speak with an academic advisor from your target faculty help with course planning. Some Concordia degree and certificate programs require you to take specific courses to be eligible for admission while others do not have specific requirements other than a certain cumulative grade point average (CGPA). If this is your first time studying at Concordia and you previously took CEGEP courses, you may be exempt from equivalent courses at Concordia. Many of the math and science courses required for admission to degrees have prerequisites. Reference the recommended courses for independent students and browse the Arts and Science elective courses open to independent students. Course registration For instructions on how to register for courses, follow our step-by-step guide.",
      "Course prerequisites Some courses at Concordia have a prerequisite requirement, meaning that the course requires you to first take the prerequisite (first) course before you take the next course. A common example is that MATH 201 or equivalent must be completed before taking MATH 203 or MATH 204. You may have already fulfilled some prerequisites if you previously studied in CEGEP or another university. Some high school math courses will also fulfill some prerequisites. If you want to take a course with prerequisites, you will need to show that you have already completed the prerequisite course. If you took a course in CEGEP that you would like recognized in order to take a higher-level course, please review the equivalencies and then submit this form (CEGEP course exemption request). If you took a high school or university class you would like recognized as a prerequisite, complete a Prerequisite Waiver Form.",
      "Prerequisite waivers can take two weeks or more, so don’t wait until the last minute to submit one. The processing of the forms may take up to five (5) working days. Requests submitted within five (5) working days of the final registration date (DNE) of the respective term may not be processed in time to register for the desired course(s). TIP: If you have not previously completed certain prerequisite courses, it’s best to fit them into your schedule now, so that you have access to your desired course in a later semester. If it has been several years since you completed the prerequisite course, it is advisable to take the course again in order to have a strong foundation for taking higher-level courses. Independent students begin registering for courses after degree program students have the chance to register. This is approximately one month before the beginning of the academic term.",

If you would like to exceed this maximum and take 12 credits, you must submit a special request.",
      "Permission is given to students who have completed at least 9 credits at Concordia and have a 2.7 CGPA. Course scheduling tips: Set aside a minimum of five hours of study time each week per course (in addition to the time you spend in class). Many classes may require additional study time!

      "“I need help using Concordia’s online course registration system.” Read through the Course Registration How-To Guides. Contact the Welcome Crew Mentors, who can show you how to navigate the course registration system. “The course I want to take is full.” The registration period for independent students only opens one month before classes begin, whereas students in programs can start registering months in advance. This means that sometimes the classes you want to take will already be full. Add yourself to the waitlist, if the course has one. In the first two weeks of classes, the waitlist will begin to move as students will be attending their courses and dropping them for different reasons. It’s important to watch your email and portal for updates on the waitlist. If the course doesn’t have a waitlist, frequently check the course registration numbers in case a spot becomes available.",
      "“The course I want to take has spots available, but I can’t enrol in it.” Confirm that you have completed any prerequisite requirements for the course. There are many courses that independent students cannot take because they are reserved exclusively for students in a degree program (such as most Fine Arts and John Molson School of Business courses). Add yourself to the course waitlist if this option is available. Seats may open up closer to the start of classes. Contact the department offering the course to find out their policy for allowing non-program students to take the class. “The course I want to take has a prerequisite requirement, so I can’t register.” Refer to the course description to check the prerequisite requirements. If you want to take a course with prerequisites, you will need to show that you have already completed an equivalent course. If you completed an equivalent course in CEGEP, submit a CEGEP course exemption request.",
      "If you believe you completed an equivalent course in high school or university, submit a Prerequisite Waiver Form with your transcripts. These requests can take up to 10 business days to process. Please take registration deadlines into consideration and submit your request as soon as possible. “I want to take 12 credits in the winter semester.” Independent students can take courses on a part-time basis, which means fewer than 12 credits per term in the fall and winter and a maximum of 12 credits over the summer terms. If you want to request an exception to this rule to take 12 credits in the fall or winter semester, you can request a course overload by submitting a Student Request Form to undergrad.independent@concordia.ca. Academic regulations As an independent student, you follow the same Concordia rules and regulations as certificate or degree program students. You can find the academic regulations in the undergraduate calendar.",
      "Once you’ve been granted authorization to register for courses as an undergraduate independent student, this authorization is valid for 6 consecutive terms (2 years). This means that even if you don’t register for any courses in the term you first applied to, you can register for courses for up to 2 years without submitting a new application. A new application will be required after 2 years of not taking any classes. The Independent Student Request Committee reviews exceptions to academic regulations, or related matters. You may submit an Independent Student Request Form and supporting documentation directly to the Independent Student Request Committee. Decisions are normally made within (30) working days of receiving the request and will be final. Types of exceptions include: Late withdrawals Registering for 12 credits in one term Taking a course for a third time It is your responsibility to officially withdraw from a course.",
      "There are two main ways you can withdraw from a course in your Student Centre during the academic term.

Here's what those terms mean. Conditions The conditions section of your offer letter outlines any conditions you need to meet before starting your degree at Concordia. You will not receive a new letter once the condition is fulfilled. Exemption An exemption won't decrease the number of credits you need to complete your degree but it will let you skip ahead to a more advanced course. If you have received an exemption for a particular course, you can't take that course at Concordia and receive credit for it.",
      "If you have received an exemption for a course that's required for your program, connect with your program advisor to discuss what course you should take instead. Note: The exemptions and potential exemptions awarded are based on the information available at the time this offer was issued. These may change based on the evaluation of course equivalencies and final grades received. To see the most current list of exemptions, and to ensure you're not registered in a course you are exempted from, please check your student record regularly. Deficiency A deficiency is a course required to get into your program that you have not completed. You need to complete courses identified as deficiencies as early in your studies as possible. Transfer credits Transfer credits are credits you earned from your prior studies. These credits may count towards your program of study or your electives.",
