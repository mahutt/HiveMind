      "The Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) in Software Engineering is offered by the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science at Concordia University. The program takes 4 to 5 years to complete and is based at the Sir George Williams (SGW) campus. Experiential learning opportunities include a Co-op program. Students can start in the Fall or Winter terms. Virtual information sessions are available to prospective students to learn about the program and the school's focus on advancing integrated technologies responsibly.",
      "Software Engineering students learn to design, code, and test software products, covering topics such as software architectures, refactoring, DevOps, and microprocessors. The program emphasizes balancing development with factors like safety, reliability, cost, and scheduling. Concordia was among the first Canadian universities to offer an undergraduate Software Engineering program. Students gain hands-on experience in labs specializing in software analytics, big data, networks, 3D graphics, high-performance computing, and AI. Graduates are eligible to become registered professional engineers, as all engineering programs are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board.",
      "Students study the full life cycle of software, from specification to maintenance and evaluation, and work with professional techniques and tools. The student-run Software Engineering and Computer Science Student Society (SCS) organizes coding nights, algorithm practice, tutorials, social events, and networking opportunities. Special funding is available for out-of-province students, offering up to $4,000 for undergraduate programs. The degree requires 120 to 150 credits, depending on the student's academic background. The curriculum includes an Engineering core, a Software Engineering core, and electives in Real-time, Embedded, or Avionics software.",
      "The Co-op program includes three paid work terms of 12 to 16 weeks each, allowing students to develop, program, design, and test software in real-world settings. Admission criteria vary by academic background. For Quebec CEGEP students, a minimum overall CRC of 27 is required, along with specific math and physics courses. High school students need an A- average, including an A- in math and B+ in physics. Various international qualifications, such as the International Baccalaureate (IB), Baccalauréat français, and British GCE A-levels, are also accepted, with specific course requirements.",
      "University transfer students require a minimum 3.0 GPA overall and in math/physics for internal transfers, and an A- overall with B+ in math/physics for external transfers. Application deadlines for Fall entry are March 1 (February 1 for international students), and November 1 (August 1 for international students) for Winter entry. Admission can close anytime after the deadline without prior notice. Quebec residents in eligible programs can apply for the Quebec Perspective Bursary ($2,500 per term). A U.S. Federal Student Aid-eligible version of the program is available, excluding Co-op and e-courses to meet U.S. regulations."

      "The Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Art Education is offered through the Faculty of Fine Arts at the Sir George Williams (SGW) campus. It is available as a Major, Minor, or Specialization, with a duration of three to five years, starting in the Fall term. The program prepares students to teach and create visual art in classrooms and community centers. Students receive training in artistic disciplines, engage in internships, and can apply for the specialization program leading to provincial certification. The program emphasizes personal growth, artistic development, and teaching expertise in small class settings.",
      "Students can contribute to InArte, a student-run research-creation journal, and develop skills as artists, researchers, and educators. Special funding of up to $4,000 is available for out-of-province undergraduate students. Quebec residents may qualify for the Quebec Perspective Bursary, which provides up to $2,500 per term. A U.S. Federal Student Aid-eligible version of the program is available for American students, meeting U.S. regulations. Graduates of the specialization program can obtain teacher certification from the Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur (MES), provided they meet English language proficiency requirements.",
      "The BFA in Art Education offers three pathways: Specialization in Art Education – Visual Arts (120 credits), Major in Art Education – Visual Arts (66 credits), and Minor in Art Education – Visual Arts (24 credits). Admission is initially to the major, and after completing 60 credits, students may apply for the specialization program if they wish to pursue in-school teaching. The specialization program qualifies graduates for provincial teacher certification. The curriculum includes broad and intensive artistic training alongside education-focused coursework.",
      "The program admits students only in the Fall term. Minimum cut-off averages vary by educational background: Quebec CEGEP (DEC), High School (C+), International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma (26), Baccalauréat français (11), and British A-levels (CD). University transfer students need a minimum C average. Applicants must submit a letter of intent and a portfolio. While the official deadline is March 1 (February 1 for international applicants), applications may close earlier depending on demand. Admission is not guaranteed even for those meeting the minimum requirements.",
      "Graduates can pursue careers as high school and elementary art teachers, museum and gallery educators, and instructors in community art programs. They may work with at-risk youth, elderly adults, women’s shelters, hospitals, and long-term care facilities. Some choose self-employment as artist-teachers. The program also serves as a foundation for graduate studies in Creative Arts Therapies when combined with undergraduate coursework in Psychology."
